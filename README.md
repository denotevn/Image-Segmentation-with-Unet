## The Dataset from this link: **[Dataset](https://github.com/parth1620/Human-Segmentation-Dataset-master.git)**

## Theory of Segmentation Image: **[This link](https://towardsdatascience.com/image-segmentation-part-1-9f3db1ac1c50)**

## 1. What is image segmentation?
+ Image segmentation is a method in which a digital image is broken down into various subgroups called Image segments which helps in reducing the complexity of the image to make further processing or analysis of the image simpler
+ Segmentation in easy words is assigning labels to pixels
## 2. Knowledge learned
+ Augmentation image with **albumentations**
+ Experiment with Pytorch
+ Experience Segmentation with U-net
